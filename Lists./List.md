List is used to store collections of data.

The syntax is 

```
list1 = ["red" , "orange", "blue", "green"]
```

We can access elements with their index.
Index in a list starts from 0.

```
list1 = ["red" , "orange", "blue", "green"]
print (list1[1])
>>> orange
```
To delete an item in the list del keyword is used.
```
list1 = ["red" , "orange", "blue", "green"]
del list1[1]
print(list1)
>>> [red , blue , green]
```
